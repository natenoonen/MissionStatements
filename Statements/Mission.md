My mission is to:
1. Demonstrate and expand my authentic and curious **faith** in things known, unknown and unknowable.
2. Embody and share my encouraging and enabling **hope** in things I can see and those I cannot.
3. Give and receive beautiful and sacrificial **love** between myself and my communities.

***To fulfill this I will:

1. **Invest In myself first:
	1. **Plans are worthless, planning is invaluable:** Create realistic plans using my EPT focusing on the process and the results. Laugh, think and cry every day to practice holistic health.
	6. **Continuously learn and grow:** Learn through action, direct curiosity and research.  Embrace the inevitable mistakes that will be made which offer opportunities for learning.
	7. Celebrate my accomplishments AND effort so that I am filled with light and true joy. 
	8. Be trustworthy: 
	9. **Set and maintain boundaries:** Recognize those who love me and those who don't.  Separate intimate friends, professional relationships, created family, and relatives.
2. Live in a healthy family and community
	1. **Think long term:** Start with seventh generation thinking considering impacts beyond my own life.
	2. **Love well:** Give and receive love that includes mutual respect, open communication, and willingness to confront and overcome challenges. Share the limited resources (time, money, energy, etc) I have with love and wisdom so that I can balance the present and the future. 
	3. **Begin with my family:** Invest deliberately in Kimmy, Charlotte and Jane so that my strongest and most important human relationships endure until my death. Spend time reflecting and checking in.
	4. Create trust
	5. Treat conflict as inevitable, healthy and something to learn and grow from and through. Don't regularly create them and don't run from them.
	6. Encourage and celebrate the accomplishments AND effort of those around me.
	7. Share and delegate work that I can accomplish to help those around me grow. Ask for help when I inevitably need it. Include others even when I can do it faster. Move at my own pace and deliberately speed up or slow down for the benefit myself and the community.
	8. Share with humility and seek first to understand and then to be understood to tear down my cultural defensiveness so that I operate well in community.
	9. Embrace the wisdom and knowledge of those around me.
